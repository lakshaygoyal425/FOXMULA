# Assignment-1


1. Create a class called Time, which has three private instance variables â€“ hour, min and sec. It contains a
method called add ( ) which takes one Time object as parameter and print the added value of the calling
Time object and passes Time object. In the main method, declare two Time objects and assign values
using constructor and call the add ( ) method.


2. Create a class Stack that declares a stack and the methods to perform push ( ), pop ( ) and checkEmpty (
) operations on the stack. Create two stacks and write a menu-driven program to perform operations on
the two stacks. Whenever the number of elements in the two stacks becomes equal, a message should
automatically be generated displaying the number of elements in each stack.


3. Write an inheritance hierarchy for classes Quadrilateral, Trapezoid, Parallelogram, Rectangle and Square.
Use Quadrilateral as the super class of the hierarchy. The instance variables of Quadrilateral should be
the x-y coordinate pairs for the four endpoints of the Quadrilateral. Write a program that instantiates
objects of your classes and outputs each object's area (except Quadrilateral).
